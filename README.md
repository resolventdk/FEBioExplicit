# FEBioExplicit
Reworked version of FEBio's explicit solver

# TODO
* [x] Keep track of stable time step
* [x] Density map generator to achieve selected stable time step (mass scaling)
* [x] Fix rigid body equations not being solved
* [ ] Keep track of stable time step for contact interface, adjust penalty to preserve same stable time step
* [ ] Implement damping in contact interface
* [ ] Implement bulk viscosity damping
